This is the source code for my personal website for my [software development
consultancy web site](https://stroiman.com).

As I am a big fan of open-source software, and this is build using open-source
software, I also want to give back to the community.

As this doesn't contain any information that is not already publically
available, or intended to be published soon, I have no problems also making this
source code publically available.

## License

This doesn't contain a license file, as the contents 

Any code or files that contain personal information is obviously personal to me,
for which you are **not** permitted to copy/use it. This is pretty much
everything in the `/app/i18n/locales` directory. But use your best judgement
here

All other code, i.e. _pretty much everything outside `/app/i18n/locales`_, is
provided under the conditions of the MIT license.

If you are in doubt, feel free to contact me.
